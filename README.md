## Description
Where's My Food is intended for use by resturants and food delivery companies to help customers keep track of when their ordered food will be delivered. This application will text a gif with a countdown of when the customer's food will arrive and it updates in real time depending on the drivers location and number of stops whilekeeping the drivers exact location private from the customer. Text updates will also be sent to the customer when the driver is five minutes away and when the driver arrivesat the customer's location. Both of these texts will include a temporary number to contact the delivery driver to give them additional instructions for the delivery.
